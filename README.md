PURPOSE: Myopia is increasing worldwide and possibly linked to education. In this
study, we analyse the association of myopia and education in the U.S. and
investigate its age-dependency.
METHODS: We conducted a secondary data analysis using the public use files from
the cross-sectional study National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey of the
period from 1999 to 2008. 19,756 participants aged 20 to 85 years were included
with data on education and ophthalmic parameters (distance visual acuity,
objective refraction and keratometry). Spherical equivalent, astigmatism, corneal
power and corneal astigmatism were evaluated for an association with education
using linear regression analysis with adjustment of potential confounders.
RESULTS: Analysis revealed an association between spherical equivalent and
educational level in the univariate analysis (P < .001), and in the adjusted
model (P < .001). Subjects who attend school to less than 9th grade had a mean
spherical equivalent of 0.34 D, subjects with 9-11th grade -0.14 D, subjects that
finished high school -0.33 D, subjects with partial college education -0.70 D,
subjects that graduated from college or a higher formal education -1.22 D.
Subjects that graduated from college or above were -1.47 D more myopic compared
to subjects that completed less than 9th grade school in the adjusted analyses.
Astigmatism and corneal curvature was not associated with education.
CONCLUSIONS: Myopia is associated with higher education in the U.S. Our analysis 
shows that corneal curvature does not contribute to this association, therefore
axial elongation or lens power are likely to contribute to myopia.
